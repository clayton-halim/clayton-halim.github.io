I made my first website about a year ago, and I thought it was pretty good for a first website. However I think the one page design doesn't really fit the goal of the site. I want to use this site to showcase all the different things that I do, so I decided to split up the site into its respective categories.

I was also running Windows at the time which made it really annoying to install Jekyll. Now running Ubuntu 17.04 on my laptop, installing Jekyll is as simple as running `sudo apt install jekyll`! If you're wondering what Jekyll is, it's a static site generator which prevents you from repeating a lot of code that you write down. A good example are these blog posts that take simple text files (actually markdown) and pastes it into a bunch of html that you'd write for each html file anyways, then it can generate a page which lists all the posts you've made! Making your own website gives you a lot more freedom on how your site looks and operates if you're into that.

There's so much more you can do, if you're interested check this excellent [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWjCJDeWfDdfVEcLGAfdJn_HXyM4Y7_k-).

My next focus was to come up with a branding. I thought, my favourite fruit is a watermelon, and I really like to code, so why not combine a watermelon and a terminal prompt together? I think it looks pretty cute, so I'm going to be make a digital version very soon.

As an accent colour, I chose pink because it's a very gentle color and it also goes well with white.

Honestly I think that much is enough really because I'm not some kind of organization, I really just wanted a clean site. 

I've been working on this for a couple days now and I'm very happy with how it turned out! :D
